Introduction
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Welcome to the technical introduction of Sudoku Solver! More than just a game, this project is a true test of your logical prowess. Our mission is to provide you with an interactive platform that allows you to fully immerse yourself in the joy of unraveling captivating Sudoku puzzles.

In this session, we will delve into the unique and engaging features that set Sudoku Solver apart. At the core of the game lies a 9x9 grid of boxes eagerly awaiting the challenge of being filled with the numbers 1 to 9. But that's not all â€“ we've added a set of powerful buttons to enhance your experience and ensure a smooth journey through the game.

The reset button is your gateway to a clean slate, enabling you to start fresh with every attempt. When you need a break from the challenge, the exit button is there to gracefully close the game and allow you to return whenever you desire. And for those challenging moments when you're stuck and seeking guidance, the solution button is at your service, ready to reveal the expected answers and nudge you in the right direction.

But, of course, the thrill lies in overcoming each puzzle yourself. To keep you engaged and motivated, the check moves button will validate your choices, ensuring that every move you make brings you one step closer to victory.

The beauty of this project is that we will build it entirely from scratch. As you join us on this creative journey, we will work together to craft an extraordinary combination of a 9x9 matrix of buttons, giving life to the Sudoku Solver.
